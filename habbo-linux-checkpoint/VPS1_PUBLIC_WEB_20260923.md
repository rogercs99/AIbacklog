# VPS1 public web publication and iPhone connectivity — 2026-09-23

## Symptom sequence and root cause

The first Safari failure was caused by a missing public DNS record for `habbo.gamemodai.pro`; that was corrected through the existing Cloudflare Tunnel.

After DNS publication, the user still reported that the site would not load correctly from iPhone. Reproduction from VPS2/control host `ES217221` then showed a second, independent problem: the dynamic HTML returned HTTP 200, but core Havana frontend files such as `landing.js` and `frontpage.css` returned HTTP 404.

Two deployment details caused the remaining problem:
1. the Havana checkout had an incomplete `tools/www` tree; Havana distributes the legacy web assets separately;
2. Cloudflare still routed `/web-gallery`, `/styles` and `/js` to the static server on port 18080, bypassing the completed Havana web tree on port 18081.

## Final public architecture

Cloudflare ingress on VPS1:
- `/c_images`, `/client`, `/gordon`, `/dcr`, `/flash` -> `http://127.0.0.1:18080` (`habbo-static`);
- all other `habbo.gamemodai.pro` traffic, including `/web-gallery`, `/styles`, `/js` and dynamic pages -> `http://127.0.0.1:18081` (Havana web).

MariaDB, Shockwave, MUS, Flash and RCON remain loopback-only. No Habbo firewall opening was added. The existing Stremio ingress continues to use the same Cloudflare connector.

## Frontend overlay

Upstream Havana documentation requires the separate `havana_www` bundle to populate `tools/www`.

Verified source bundle:
- file: `havana_www_10_09_2024.7z`;
- size: 508016467 bytes;
- SHA-256: `877273abddab946849aed3d5d2416185fe175a7207a602890fd08ebe7e376ed0`;
- archive integrity: PASS.

Only the required `web-gallery` tree was retained: 1030 files, approximately 24 MB.

Persistent VPS1 overlay:
`/srv/habbo/web-frontend-assets`

`docker-compose.yml` bind-mounts:
- `web-gallery` -> `/havana-web/tools/www/web-gallery`;
- `styles` -> `/havana-web/tools/www/styles`;
- `js` -> `/havana-web/tools/www/js`;
- `images` -> `/havana-web/tools/www/images`.

Core file hashes:
- `landing.js`: `3eb27fe0dd38e96b743c02f8e36a161cae84c593c8022f508facb154a5be2a99`;
- `frontpage.css`: `fe15fb858023252f0acdb4b049bef4046c4c67bd833c05633004d635abbe587a`;
- `favicon.ico`: `ec6b2907037b7bd4e7ac7fbc0c9be8b1106999f5a15534b66d8af0a68c4098a4`.

Compatibility:
- `/web-gallery/v2/images/dialogs` links to the official legacy dialogs tree;
- `/images/progress_bubbles.gif` is exposed from the official bundle;
- `/styles/local/uk.css` and `/js/local/uk.js` are harmless empty compatibility paths; the upstream local UK JS is itself empty.

A few old CSS selectors still reference decorative image names absent from both the verified `havana_www` archive and the current Quackster Havana-www/Kepler-www trees. They are not critical page payload.

## Validation and CDN cache

The live origin is validated by `/srv/habbo/ops/public-web-smoke.sh`. It uses an iPhone Safari user agent, retries transient VPS2 resolver/network errors and sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` plus `Pragma: no-cache` so stale CDN objects cannot hide the current origin state.

Final result:
- public web smoke from VPS1: PASS;
- public web smoke from VPS2: PASS;
- `/` and `/register`: HTTP 200;
- core JS/CSS/favicon: HTTP 200;
- compatibility dialog/progress assets: HTTP 200 when revalidated against origin;
- R39 variables and V31 DCR: HTTP 200;
- backend Habbo smoke: PASS.

Cloudflare had retained some pre-fix decorative 404 responses with `max-age=14400`. A normal cached request could temporarily return the old 404 while the same URL with no-cache or a cache-busting query reached the repaired origin and returned HTTP 200. This is CDN cache state, not an origin connectivity failure.

VPS2 also showed isolated resolver/network timeouts during repeated tests; retrying succeeded and independent requests continued resolving the hostname.

## Operations and recovery

Public smoke:
`/srv/habbo/ops/public-web-smoke.sh`

Backup workflow:
`/srv/habbo/ops/backup.sh`

The backup now stores the persistent frontend overlay as:
`web-frontend-overlay.tar.gz`

Latest verified post-fix backup:
`/srv/habbo/backups/manual-20260923T215347Z`

That backup passes `gzip -t` and every entry in `SHA256SUMS`, and contains the frontend overlay, Cloudflare configuration, compose file, ops helpers, project context and DB dump.

The earlier database restore-roundtrip-tested backup remains:
`/srv/habbo/backups/manual-20260923T183558Z`

## Regression status

After the final Cloudflare routing correction:
- `habbo-stack`: active;
- `habbo-static`: active;
- `habbo-websockify`: active;
- `cloudflared-stremio-legacy`: active;
- Docker: active;
- nginx: active;
- Stremio public endpoint: expected HTTP 307;
- Habbo backend smoke: PASS;
- public smoke from VPS1 and VPS2: PASS.

The canonical FINAL-v2 ZIP remains unchanged with SHA-256 `f80bbefc5a486fd0f9cce058a39462ef3925c563253dc2f69ebe647f6a6630ec`. This repair is a VPS1 deployment/publication overlay, so no new canonical release is created.
